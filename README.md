# Sector
## An Android application for security monitoring and reporting.

Mobile platforms have become commonplace in the lives of millions of people in the United States and abroad. This technology is evolving so quickly that it is sometimes difficult to track the new trends and products as they become available to consumers. As a Cyber Security professional, I have been trying to keep up with these trends and the security implications that they create. I have found the security concerns of applications from the app store the most troubling and ambiguous so far. All Android users have seen the familiar, “Application X needs access to the following items:” and then a long list of resources listed below on the phone and I know I’m not alone when I ask, “What the heck for?” 

The goal of Sector is to flesh out what resources these applications are using in an attempt to shed some light on why they may need them. 
#### Sector will:
* Show a list of the applications on the phone
* Give details about what resources the applications are currently using
* Show details about what the application requested when it was installed on the device
* And, provide a good looking/intuitive interface for the user

Sector is meant to be a monitoring application and will never be intrusive or bug you with popup notifications and reminders to check back in with it. The merit in Sector is its ability to bring you up to speed about what your technology is doing behind the scenes and give you some comfort about the applications that you are downloading from the app store.
